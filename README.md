# Convolution - Image Processing with Python

## Description
This project is focused on image processing using Python. It utilizes the concept of convolution, a mathematical operation that is a special kind of linear transformation. Convolution is used in image processing to modify the appearance of an image, such as blurring, sharpening, edge detection, and more.

## Features
- Image Loading: Load images for processing using popular formats like JPEG, PNG, etc.
- Convolution Operations: Apply various convolution operations to images like blurring, sharpening, edge detection, etc.
- Image Saving: Save the processed images in desired formats.

## Installation
To install the necessary libraries for this project, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
To use this project, follow the steps below:

Load your image using the load_image function.
Apply the desired convolution operation using the corresponding function.
Save the processed image using the save_image function.
